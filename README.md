Machine Learning Methods
Which machine learning methods were applied in the application?
We utilized two supervised machine learning methods: Decision Tree and Naive Bayes for classification.
Additionally, the K-Means clustering algorithm was employed for unsupervised machine learning.
Prediction Accuracy
How accurate is the solution of prediction?
Decision Tree Model: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 79.93% on the test dataset.
Naive Bayes Model: Attained an accuracy of approximately 85.71% on the test dataset.
Decisive Factors for Quitting a Job
Which factors play a significant role in employee attrition?
Features with the highest correlation with attrition: 'OverTime', 'TotalWorkingYears', and 'jobLevel'.
Higher Risk Work Positions and Departments
Which work positions and departments are at a higher risk of losing employees?
The sales department and sales representatives appear to be overwhelmingly represented.
Gender Pay Equality
Are employees of different genders paid equally in all departments?
On average, females earn more than males, except for the sales department where they earn the same.
Work-Life Balance Factors
Do family status and distance from work influence work-life balance?
There seems to be almost no correlation between family status, distance from work, and work-life balance.
Education and Work Satisfaction
Does education influence job satisfaction?
Seemingly, there is not much correlation between work satisfaction and education.
Project Development Challenges
What were the challenges in project development?
Selecting appropriate features for analysis.
Fine-tuning machine learning models, especially given our novice status in this domain.
