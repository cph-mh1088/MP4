- Which machine learning methods did you choose to apply in the application?
  We've applied two supervised machine learning methods: Decision Tree and Naive Bayes for classification. Additionally, we've used the K-Means clustering algorithm for unsupervised machine learning.

- How accurate is your solution of prediction?
  For the Decision Tree model, the accuracy on the test dataset is approximately 79.93%. The Naive Bayes model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85.71% on the test dataset.

- Which are the most decisive factors for quitting a job?
  The features with the highest correlation with attrition were 'OverTime','TotalWorkingYears' and 'jobLevel'

- Which work positions and departments are in higher risk of losing employees?
  The sales department and sales representatives seems to be overwelmingly represented

- Are employees of different gender paid equally in all departments?
  When taking an average salary per month, females appear to earn more then men, except for the sales department where they earn the same.

- Do the family status and the distance from work influence the work-life balance?
  Apparently not. There seems to be almost no correlation.

- Does education make people happy (satisfied from the work)?
  Seemingly there does not seem to much correlation between work satisfaction and education

- Which were the challenges in the project development?
  The challenges in this project were selectiong appropriate feauteres for analysis, aswell as fine-tuning machine learning models, since we're newbies.
