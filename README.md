## Machine Learning Methods

- **Which machine learning methods were applied in the application?**
  - We utilized two supervised machine learning methods: Decision Tree and Naive Bayes for classification.
  - Additionally, the K-Means clustering algorithm was employed for unsupervised machine learning.

## Prediction Accuracy

- **How accurate is the solution of prediction?**
  - Decision Tree Model: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 79.93% on the test dataset.
  - Naive Bayes Model: Attained an accuracy of approximately 85.71% on the test dataset.

## Decisive Factors for Quitting a Job

- **Which factors play a significant role in employee attrition?**
  - Features with the highest correlation with attrition: 'OverTime', 'TotalWorkingYears', and 'jobLevel'.

## Higher Risk Work Positions and Departments

- **Which work positions and departments are at a higher risk of losing employees?**
  - The sales department and sales representatives appear to be overwhelmingly represented.

## Gender Pay Equality

- **Are employees of different genders paid equally in all departments?**
  - On average, females earn more than males, except for the sales department where they earn the same.

## Work-Life Balance Factors

- **Do family status and distance from work influence work-life balance?**
  - There seems to be almost no correlation between family status, distance from work, and work-life balance.

## Education and Work Satisfaction

- **Does education influence job satisfaction?**
  - Seemingly, there is not much correlation between work satisfaction and education.

## Project Development Challenges

- **What were the challenges in project development?**
  - Selecting appropriate features for analysis.
  - Fine-tuning machine learning models, especially given our novice status in this domain.
